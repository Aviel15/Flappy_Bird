# Flappy_Bird
Hey,
I created the Flappy Bird game and added a sign-up and login screen.
Each user has a personal record that adds interest and passion to the game.
I used the database login screen via firebase and the player bird's best record score is via shared preferences.
The main elements I used in this repo:
Threads, 
 Shared preferences,
 Firebase,
 Graphics,
 Short sounds, 
 Dialog and menu,
 Sensors,
 Intents

The game has a screen of instructions if there is something that is not clear.
